        <p>Okay so what your going to need is</p>
        <p>Your school chromebook</p>
        <p>A school computer with your email that you made for Ms.Shellers Class</p>
        <p>Then your going to go to</p>
            <a href="https://login.yahoo.com/?.lang=en-US&src=homepage&.done=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yahoo.com%2F&pspid=2023538075&activity=ybar-signin">Yahoo Mail</a>
        <p>BTW on the school computer to set it up</p>
        <p> then go sign up then click where it says sign up with google</p>
        <p>Then PUT IN THE BUSINESS EMAIL NOT YOUR SCHOOL EMAIL</p>
        <p>then it should be running your gmail thru the ymail email engine</p>
        <p> then go to the chromebook sign in yahoo with the email and password. I think you have to set up a password on the yahoo on the school computer so go the settings and make sure the password is good.</p>
        <p> for the slow people, after you signed in thru google, THEN GO TO</p>
        <a href="mail.yahoo.com">mail.yahoo.com</a>
