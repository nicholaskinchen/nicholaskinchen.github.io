                   I am Nicholas Kinchen, I want to go some kind of Technical School to learn about Web Developement. I think that I am best with the front end of code that goes into making websites. The backend of the code is being put on the back burners for now. I am probably going to go to VoTech, atleast that's where my parents said I am going to be going. I would try to go to some other type of college that has Web Developement. Then I am going to try to make websites out to start then go on from there. That is all that I have planned currently nothing is in stone. If you want I have all of the things that I have done currently in my portfolio at the top of this page.
